Random Quote Generator

I developed the JavaScript for this Random Quote Generator. 
After loading the html in any browser, a random quote themed on persitance is loaded with other pertinent information.
I am attempting to get a grade of exceeds expectations.  In order to do so, I added the property of 'nationality'
to the quotes array's objects and provided values for the 'year' and 'citation' properties for more than one quote object. To make
the nationality property appear correctly in the body, I modified the styles.css file:
  .nationality:before {
    content: ", ";
    font-styel: normal;
  }
Also, I coded the file, so the page auto-refreshes after every ten seconds with a new quote and background color.
